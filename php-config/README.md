# PHP Configuration Directory

This directory contains PHP configuration files for the local Docker environment.

The `php.ini` file will be automatically generated by the `setup_local_dev.sh` script and is mounted into the Docker container.

Do not commit `php.ini` to version control (it's in .gitignore), but you can modify it locally to adjust PHP settings for your development environment.
